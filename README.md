# Sandbox
Welcome, welcome, to the Glorious C++ Sandbox!!

This is my personal playground for experimenting new stuff and toying around with C++, and all things around it. I will be opening new branches as new experiments are made. The master branch will always be the core project used by the other ones.

## Core Project Structure
I created a simple environment so a range of projects could be created in it. So far, it uses CMake and Shell Script (for automating the whole build process, y'know).

## How to use it
Will write this soon.
